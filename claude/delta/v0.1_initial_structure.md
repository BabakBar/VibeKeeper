# Delta Summary: v0.1 - Initial Repository Structure

## Overview
This delta summary documents the creation and initial organization of the VibeKeeper repository. The project is in a very early stage with minimal code, primarily consisting of the basic SwiftUI app template and technical specification documents.

## Changes Summary

### Added Files
- `VibeKeeper.xcodeproj/` - Initial Xcode project configuration
- `VibeKeeper/VibeKeeperApp.swift` - App entry point with basic structure
- `VibeKeeper/ContentView.swift` - Initial content view with placeholder UI
- `docs/VibeKeeper.md` - Technical specification defining the project scope and architecture
- `docs/VibeKeeper-spec.md` - Implementation specification with code examples
- `claude/` - Directory structure for Claude-optimized metadata and assistance

### Modified Files
None (initial commit).

### Removed Files  
None (initial commit).

## API Changes
No public APIs have been established yet. The project is in the scaffolding phase with only the basic SwiftUI app structure in place.

## Behavior Changes
No functionality has been implemented beyond the default SwiftUI app template.

## Reasoning Behind Changes
The repository was created to implement a gift idea tracking app called VibeKeeper. The technical specification (`docs/VibeKeeper.md`) outlines an iOS-first app for capturing and organizing gift ideas and important dates for friends and family. The app will use AI to extract relevant information from text, voice, or image inputs and will include reminders for upcoming occasions.

The implementation specification (`docs/VibeKeeper-spec.md`) provides detailed instructions for building the backend and iOS client, including code samples, data models, and API endpoints.

The Claude-specific directory structure (`claude/`) was added to enhance the development experience when working with Claude Code. This includes:
- Metadata about components and their relationships
- Semantic code indexing for better understanding
- Pattern libraries for consistent implementation
- Cheat sheets for quick reference
- Common issues and solutions database
- Model-friendly documentation

## Implications for Development
The project is now ready for initial development with a clear specification and architecture plan. The next steps will involve implementing the core data models and UI components as outlined in the technical specification.

Key focus areas for the upcoming development:
1. Implementing the data models for gift ideas, contacts, and reminders
2. Building the capture service for text, voice, and image inputs
3. Developing the UI components for the main app screens
4. Implementing local persistence with Swift Data or CoreData
5. Setting up the AI integration for entity extraction

## Technical Notes
- The project is set up as an iOS SwiftUI app targeting iOS 16+
- Will follow MVVM architecture pattern
- Initial development phase will focus on local storage with Swift Data/CoreData
- No backend integration is implemented yet, though specifications are provided
- Claude-optimized documentation is in place for enhanced development assistance

## Decisions and Trade-offs
1. **iOS-First Approach**: The decision to start with iOS only (rather than cross-platform) allows for faster initial development and leveraging of platform-specific features.
2. **Swift and SwiftUI**: Modern Swift and SwiftUI were chosen for their declarative UI paradigm and integration with Apple's ecosystem.
3. **Local-First Storage**: Initial implementation will use local storage for simplicity, with sync capabilities planned for later phases.
4. **Claude Integration**: Extensive documentation and metadata specifically for Claude Code was added to enhance development productivity.

## Future Work
The following areas will be addressed in upcoming commits:
1. Implement core data models (User, Contact, GiftIdea, Reminder, Occasion)
2. Build the capture service for different input types
3. Create the main app screens (gift list, detail, capture, reminders)
4. Implement local persistence
5. Set up notification system for reminders
6. Build AI entity extraction functionality
