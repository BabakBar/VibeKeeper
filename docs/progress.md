## Testing Status

Basic tests have been implemented for:
- Model creation and persistence
- Relationship verification
- SwiftData operations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Micro Increments)

1. **Gift Creation Form**
   - Implement form UI for adding new gifts
   - Add validation
   - Connect to GiftViewModel

2. **Contact Creation Form**
   - Implement form UI for adding new contacts
   - Add validation
   - Connect to ContactViewModel

3. **Gift Detail View Enhancements**
   - Implement editing capabilities
   - Add purchase status updates
   - Connect to occasions and reminders

4. **Contact Detail View Enhancements**
   - Implement editing capabilities
   - Add birthday reminder creation
   - Show occasions linked to contact

### Development Approach

For each feature:
1. Create the view components
2. Connect to the existing ViewModels
3. Test for basic functionality
4. Verify data persistence
5. Commit the working changes
6. Move to the next micro-task

## Known Issues

None at this time - foundation is in place but real-world testing is pending as views are completed.
