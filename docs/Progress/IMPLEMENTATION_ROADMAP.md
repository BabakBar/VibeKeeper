## 4. Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Path

```
Database Schema → State Management → UI Components → Logging Feature →
Dashboard → Statistics → Pricing → Settings → Testing → Release
```

### Key Dependencies

1. **Database** ← Required for all features
2. **State Management** ← Required for all features
3. **Design System** ← Required for all UI
4. **Navigation** ← Required for screen flow
5. **Logging** ← Required for statistics
6. **Statistics** ← Required for insights
7. **Pricing** ← Required for cost display

### Parallel Work Streams

**Stream 1**: Backend/Data

## 6. Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Performance issues with large datasets** | Medium | High | Implement pagination, caching, optimize queries early |
| **Platform-specific bugs** | High | Medium | Test on both platforms continuously, maintain parity |
| **Scope creep** | Medium | High | Strict MVP definition, defer non-critical features |
| **Third-party library issues** | Medium | Medium | Use stable, well-maintained libraries, have fallbacks |
| **App Store rejection** | Low | High | Follow guidelines strictly, prepare appeals |
| **Database migration issues** | Medium | High | Test migrations thoroughly, have rollback plan |
| **Time estimation errors** | High | Medium | Build buffer into timeline, prioritize ruthlessly |

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule**:
1. Deprioritize P2 features
2. Simplify animations/polish
3. Reduce scope of statistics
4. Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks

**If critical bug found**:
1. Stop feature work
2. Focus team on bug fix
3. Add regression tests
4. Review for similar issues

**If platform rejection**:
1. Review feedback carefully
2. Make required changes
3. Re-submit within 48 hours
4. Communicate with reviewers
