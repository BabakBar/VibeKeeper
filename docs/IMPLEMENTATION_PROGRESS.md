- [x] Implement edit cigarette log
- [x] Implement delete cigarette log

**Completed:**
- LogService with complete CRUD operations

- Integration with SQLite and Zustand stores
- Timestamp and notes support

### Phase 4: Statistics & Dashboard ✅
- [x] Create statistics calculation service
- [x] Implement daily stats
- [x] Implement weekly stats
- [x] Implement monthly stats
- [x] Create home/dashboard screen

**Completed:**
- StatisticsService with daily, weekly, and monthly calculations
- Summary stats (total, average, cost, streak)
- Home screen showing today's progress, recent logs, and navigation
- Real-time stats updates based on logs

### Phase 5: Cost Tracking ✅
- [x] Implement cost calculation logic
- [x] Create pricing settings model
- [x] Display cost in statistics

**Completed:**
- Cost per cigarette setting with currency symbol
- Automatic cost calculation in all statistics views
- Settings screen for configuring cost and currency

### Phase 6: UI Screens & Navigation ✅
- [x] Create home/dashboard screen
- [x] Create logs management screen
- [x] Create settings screen
- [x] Implement navigation between screens

**Completed:**
- Home screen: Today's stats, quick add, summary, recent logs
- Logs screen: View/manage logs by date, add/delete operations, date navigation
- Settings screen: Cost per cigarette, currency, daily goal, reset options
- Full navigation with modal presentations

### Phase 7: Utility Functions ✅
- [x] Create date utility functions
- [x] Implement time formatting
- [x] Add relative time calculations

**Completed:**
- formatDate, formatTime, formatDateTime functions
- getRelativeTime (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Date range functions (startOfDay, endOfDay, etc.)

## Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] Explored codebase structure
- [x] Created progress tracking file
- [x] Installed all dependencies
- [x] Set up database layer
- [x] Created state management stores
- [x] Implemented core services
- [x] Created all main screens
- [x] Set up navigation

## Features Implemented
1. **Quick Logging** - One-tap cigarette logging with current timestamp
2. **Detailed Logging** - Add cigarettes with custom time and notes
3. **Log Management** - View, edit, and delete logs by date
4. **Statistics** - Daily, weekly, and monthly analytics
5. **Cost Tracking** - Automatic cost calculation with customizable pricing
6. **Settings** - Configure cost per cigarette, currency symbol, daily goals
7. **Offline-First** - All data stored locally in SQLite
8. **Navigation** - Clean navigation between home, logs, and settings

## Next Steps (Optional Features/Improvements)
- [ ] Add charts/visualizations using Victory Native
